# Decompiled Java (placeholder)

This folder will contain the decompiled Java source of the Wurst-Client v2.14 (MC1.8) release for reference during the port. The original release assets are available here:

- https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-MCX2/releases/tag/v2.14
- JAR: https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-MCX2/releases/download/v2.14/Wurst-Client-v2.14-MC1.8.jar
- ZIP: https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-MCX2/releases/download/v2.14/Wurst-Client-v2.14-MC1.8.zip

I will decompile the JAR and commit the decompiled Java sources into this folder in the next push.
